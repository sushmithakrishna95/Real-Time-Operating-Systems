# Real-Time-Operating-Systems
• Programmed Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS) in Embedded C with the integration of both cooperative and preemptive RTOS concepts and
bolstered the priority scheduling and priority inheritance with mutexes, semaphores, and it can perform yielding and sleep tasks and can
efficiently manage CPU usage with multiple processes.
• Created and killed pthreads for performing parallel computing to decrease the latency time and made use of stacks for memory optimization.
• Analyzed the statistical summary of Processes and CPU parameters which performs the same function of ‘top’ command in Linux
• Designed UI on emulator to toggle between different modes and switching the features such as preemption in process scheduling.
